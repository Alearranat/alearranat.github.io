    <h1>Dreams Poem</h1>
    <p>
        <p>Hold fast to dreams</p>
        <p>For if dreams die</p>
        <p>Life is a broken-winged bird</p>
        <p>That cannot fly.</p>
        <p>Hold fast to dreams</p>
        <p>For when dreams go</p>
        <p>Life is a barren field</p>
        <p>Frozen with snow. </p>
